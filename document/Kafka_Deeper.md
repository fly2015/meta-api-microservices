how many clusters should we have in real world application?

The number of clusters (Kafka brokers) you should have in a real-world application depends on several factors such as the volume of data you're dealing with, 
the throughput you need, and the level of fault tolerance you want to achieve.  
In general, a Kafka cluster should have at least three brokers. 
This is because Kafka uses a consensus protocol called ZooKeeper that requires a majority of servers to agree on values. 
So, if you have only two servers and one goes down, you won't have a majority and your cluster will be unavailable. 
However, for larger applications dealing with high volumes of data and requiring high throughput, you might need more brokers. 
Some large-scale Kafka deployments even have hundreds of brokers.  
Remember, adding more brokers increases the capacity of the system, both in terms of storage and processing power. 
But it also adds complexity in terms of management and operations. T
herefore, it's important to find a balance that suits your specific needs.

a cluster is group of brokers, so how we manage many clusters?

Managing multiple Kafka clusters can be a complex task due to the distributed nature of Kafka. Here are some general strategies and tools that can be used to manage multiple Kafka clusters:  
Monitoring: It's crucial to monitor the health and performance of your Kafka clusters. Tools like LinkedIn's Burrow or Yahoo's Kafka Manager can provide insights into your clusters' status and performance.  
Configuration Management: Tools like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet can be used to manage the configuration of your Kafka clusters. These tools can help ensure that your clusters are configured consistently.  
Cluster Coordination: Apache ZooKeeper is used by Kafka for cluster coordination. ZooKeeper helps in maintaining the list of brokers that are part of the cluster, electing a controller among the brokers, and keeping track of the topics and partitions.  
Data Balancing: Kafka comes with a tool called the kafka-reassign-partitions.sh script that can be used to balance data across the brokers in your clusters.  
Backup and Recovery: Regular backups of your Kafka data are essential. Tools like Uber's uReplicator can be used for cross-cluster data replication, which can be useful for disaster recovery.  
Security Management: Security is a critical aspect of managing Kafka clusters. You need to ensure that access to your clusters is controlled and that data is encrypted. Kafka supports SSL/TLS for data encryption and SASL for authentication.  
Updates and Upgrades: Regular updates and upgrades are necessary to keep your clusters running smoothly and securely. This should be done carefully to avoid downtime.  
Multi-tenancy: If you have multiple teams or applications using your Kafka clusters, you'll need to manage access and resource usage to ensure fair usage.  
Confluent Control Center: This is a comprehensive tool for managing and monitoring Kafka clusters. It provides a user-friendly interface and a wide range of features, but it's a commercial product.

it mean the produced data must be sync beetween all Partition?
No, the produced data does not need to be synchronized between all partitions. In fact, one of the key design principles of Kafka is that data is distributed and partitioned.  When a producer sends a message to a Kafka topic, the message is assigned to a specific partition. If the topic is configured with multiple partitions, the producer will distribute the messages across these partitions based on a partitioning strategy, which could be round-robin or based on a key.  Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of records, and each record in a partition is assigned a unique offset. Consumers read from the partitions at their own pace, tracking the offset of the last consumed message to know where to continue reading next time.  This design allows Kafka to handle high-volume data streams in a distributed and fault-tolerant manner. It also enables parallel processing of the data, as different consumers can read from different partitions at the same time.

so if the produced message is stored in the partition randomly, how consumers know what the partition to consume from?
In Kafka, consumers are part of a consumer group. When a consumer group is created, Kafka will divide the topic's partitions among the consumers in the group. Each consumer in the group will read from a distinct set of partitions.  When a new consumer joins the group, Kafka will re-balance the partitions among the consumers. Similarly, if a consumer leaves the group or fails, Kafka will also re-balance the partitions.  The consumers know which partition to consume from because Kafka assigns each consumer a set of partitions from each topic the consumer group is subscribed to. The consumer will continue to read from these partitions until a re-balance occurs.  It's important to note that within a consumer group, each partition is consumed by exactly one consumer. This allows Kafka to parallelize consumption: each consumer in the group reads from a different subset of partitions, and the records within each partition are delivered to the consumer in order.  Here's a simplified example of how this works:  
A Kafka topic is created with 3 partitions: P1, P2, and P3.
A consumer group is created with 2 consumers: C1 and C2.
Kafka assigns the partitions to the consumers. For example, C1 might be assigned P1 and P2, and C2 might be assigned P3.
Each consumer reads from its assigned partitions. For example, C1 reads from P1 and P2, and C2 reads from P3.
If a new consumer (C3) joins the group, Kafka might reassign the partitions so that each consumer reads from one partition: C1 reads from P1, C2 reads from P2, and C3 reads from P3.
This assignment of partitions to consumers is handled by Kafka, and consumers don't need to worry about which partitions to read from. They just read from the partitions assigned to them.

"each partition is consumed by exactly one consumer", so how if the partition is down?
In Kafka, each partition is replicated across a configurable number of brokers for fault tolerance. This means that even if a broker that holds a partition goes down, the data is still available on other brokers.  When a broker fails, one of the replicas will be chosen as the new leader for the partition. Consumers will then start consuming data from the new leader. This process is transparent to the consumers as they simply continue to consume from the same partition.  The number of replicas and the way they are distributed across brokers is configurable and plays a crucial role in the fault tolerance of a Kafka cluster. It's important to ensure that replicas are distributed in a way that if one broker goes down, there are other brokers that can take over.  Here's a simplified example:  
A Kafka topic is created with 3 partitions: P1, P2, and P3. Each partition is replicated twice, resulting in 6 total partition replicas.
These replicas are distributed across 3 brokers: B1, B2, and B3. Each broker holds 2 partition replicas.
If B1 goes down, the replicas it held (say, P1 and P2) are still available on B2 and B3. One of these replicas will be chosen as the new leader for P1 and P2.
Consumers that were consuming from P1 and P2 on B1 will now start consuming from the new leaders on B2 and B3.
This mechanism ensures that Kafka can handle broker failures and continue to serve data to consumers.

so, how a partition and its replica are synchronized data though brokers, the data is written to the partition and its replicas at the same time?
In Kafka, when a message is produced to a partition, it is first written to the "leader" replica of that partition. The leader is one of the brokers that holds a replica of the partition. The other brokers that hold replicas of the partition are called "follower" replicas.  Once the leader has received the message, it appends the message to its local log (a data structure used to store the messages). The leader then sends a response to the producer acknowledging that it has received the message.  In the background, the follower replicas are constantly polling the leader for new messages. When the leader has new messages, it sends these messages to the followers. The followers append these messages to their own local logs.  This process ensures that the data in the leader and follower replicas is kept in sync. If the leader fails, one of the followers can take over as the new leader, ensuring that no data is lost.  It's important to note that there is a small delay between when a message is written to the leader and when it is written to the followers. This is known as replication lag. Kafka provides configurations to control how much replication lag is acceptable and how to handle situations when the lag becomes too large.  Here's a simplified example of how this works:  
A producer sends a message to a topic with a specific partition.
The leader replica for that partition receives the message and appends it to its local log.
The leader sends an acknowledgement to the producer.
The follower replicas poll the leader for new messages.
The leader sends the new message to the followers.
The followers append the message to their own local logs.
This process ensures that the data in the leader and follower replicas is kept in sync, providing fault tolerance in case of a broker failure.

why all partion are replica?
In Apache Kafka, all partitions are replicated across multiple brokers for fault tolerance. This replication ensures that even if a broker that holds a partition goes down, the data is still available on other brokers.  Here's how it works:  
When a message is produced to a partition, it is first written to the "leader" replica of that partition. The leader is one of the brokers that holds a replica of the partition. The other brokers that hold replicas of the partition are called "follower" replicas.  
Once the leader has received the message, it appends the message to its local log. The leader then sends a response to the producer acknowledging that it has received the message.  
In the background, the follower replicas are constantly polling the leader for new messages. When the leader has new messages, it sends these messages to the followers. The followers append these messages to their own local logs.  
This process ensures that the data in the leader and follower replicas is kept in sync. If the leader fails, one of the followers can take over as the new leader, ensuring that no data is lost.  So, all partitions are replicated to provide fault tolerance and high availability, ensuring that data is not lost if a broker fails.

why follower replica poll the leader, but the leader send message to follower, I am a bit consfuse here, its not consummer pattern
In Kafka, the follower replicas poll the leader for new messages. This is part of Kafka's replication protocol. The reason for this is to ensure that all replicas (followers) have the same data as the leader.  When a new message is produced, it is first written to the leader. The leader then appends the message to its local log. The follower replicas are constantly polling the leader for new messages. When they poll the leader and there are new messages, the leader sends these new messages to the followers. The followers then append these messages to their own local logs.  This process is not the same as the consumer-producer pattern. In the consumer-producer pattern, the producer sends messages to a broker, and the consumer retrieves messages from the broker. In the replication process, the follower replicas (which are also brokers) are retrieving messages from the leader (which is another broker). This is done to ensure that all replicas have the same data as the leader for fault tolerance.  So, while it might seem similar to the consumer-producer pattern, the process of follower replicas polling the leader for new messages is actually part of Kafka's replication protocol. It's a mechanism to ensure data consistency and fault tolerance across different brokers in a Kafka cluster.

why follower replicas does register themself to leader and receive data as observer pattern
In Apache Kafka, the follower replicas do not register themselves to the leader in the traditional sense of the observer pattern. Instead, they continuously poll the leader for new data. This is a design choice made by the Kafka developers for a few reasons:  
Fault Tolerance: If a follower fails, the leader doesn't need to know or care. It doesn't need to maintain a list of active followers. The failed follower will stop polling and will not receive updates, but this doesn't affect the leader or the other followers.  
Scalability: The polling model allows for a large number of followers. The leader doesn't need to keep track of all followers, just respond to poll requests. This makes the system more scalable.  
Simplicity: The polling model is simpler to implement and reason about. There's no need for complex registration and deregistration logic, or for handling notifications to a changing list of followers.  
Consistency: The polling model ensures that all replicas have the same data as the leader for fault tolerance. If a follower falls behind (its polls are delayed or fail), it will miss some data, but it can catch up in subsequent polls.  
So, while the observer pattern is a common pattern in many systems, Kafka uses a different model (polling) for data replication between leader and follower replicas. This model is better suited to Kafka's requirements for fault tolerance, scalability, and consistency.

how polling model work?
he polling model is a communication protocol used in distributed systems like Apache Kafka. Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:  
Polling Request: The follower replicas (consumers in this context) send a request to the leader replica (producer in this context) asking for any new messages. This is known as a polling request.  
Check for New Messages: The leader checks if there are any new messages that the followers haven't received yet.  
Send New Messages: If there are new messages, the leader sends these messages back to the followers in response to their polling request.  
Append New Messages: The followers receive the new messages and append them to their local logs. This ensures that the followers have the same data as the leader.  
Repeat: The followers continuously repeat this process, regularly sending polling requests to the leader for new messages. This is why it's called the polling model.  
This model ensures that all follower replicas have the same data as the leader replica, providing fault tolerance in case of a broker failure. It's important to note that there is a small delay between when a message is written to the leader and when it is written to the followers. This is known as replication lag. Kafka provides configurations to control how much replication lag is acceptable and how to handle situations when the lag becomes too large.

how the message sent to polling request, what technique behind?
In Apache Kafka, the polling process is facilitated by the Kafka protocol over TCP/IP. Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:  
Connection Establishment: The follower broker establishes a TCP/IP connection with the leader broker. This connection is used for all communication between the two brokers.  
Fetch Request: The follower broker sends a Fetch Request to the leader broker. This request includes the topic name, the partition number, and the offset of the last message the follower has successfully processed.  
Fetch Response: The leader broker receives the Fetch Request, retrieves the requested messages from its local log (starting from the specified offset), and sends these messages back to the follower in a Fetch Response.  
Message Processing: The follower broker receives the Fetch Response and appends the new messages to its local log. It then updates its offset to reflect the new messages it has processed.  
Repeat: The follower broker continuously repeats this process, regularly sending Fetch Requests to the leader broker for new messages.  
This process is facilitated by the Kafka protocol, which is a high-level protocol built on top of TCP/IP. The Kafka protocol defines the format of the Fetch Requests and Fetch Responses, as well as other types of requests and responses used for different operations in Kafka.  It's important to note that this process is asynchronous and non-blocking. The follower broker doesn't wait for a Fetch Response before it can do other work. It can send multiple Fetch Requests in parallel and process the Fetch Responses as they arrive. This allows Kafka to achieve high throughput and low latency.

what is offset?
In Apache Kafka, an offset is a unique identifier given to each record in a partition. It represents the position of the record within the partition and is used to track the progress of consumers.  When a producer sends a message to a Kafka topic, the broker stores the message in a partition and assigns it a unique offset. The offset is a sequential integer that starts from zero and increments by one for each new message. For example, the first message in a partition will have an offset of 0, the second message will have an offset of 1, and so on.  Consumers use offsets to keep track of the messages they have already read. When a consumer reads a message from a partition, it also retrieves the offset of that message. The consumer can then store this offset and use it to resume reading from the correct position if it restarts or fails.  It's important to note that offsets are local to a partition and do not provide a global ordering of messages across multiple partitions. Each partition has its own independent sequence of offsets.

What are the benefits of using offsets in Apache Kafka?
In Apache Kafka, offsets provide several benefits:

1. **Message Tracking**: Offsets allow consumers to keep track of the messages they have already read in a partition. This is crucial for ensuring that every message is processed exactly once.

2. **Fault Tolerance**: If a consumer fails or restarts, it can use the offset to resume processing from the exact point where it left off. This prevents data loss and ensures that processing can continue smoothly even in the event of failures.

3. **Parallel Processing**: Since each partition in Kafka maintains its own offset, multiple consumers can read from different partitions in parallel without interfering with each other. This allows for high throughput and efficient use of resources.

4. **Ordering Guarantees**: Within a partition, messages are ordered by their offset. This allows Kafka to provide strong ordering guarantees, ensuring that consumers see messages in the order they were written.

5. **Replayability**: Consumers can reset their offset to an earlier value to replay old messages. This can be useful for reprocessing data, debugging issues, or handling changes in business logic.

In Apache Kafka, producers and consumers don't register themselves to a partition or a topic in the traditional sense. Instead, they interact with topics as follows:

**Producers**: When a producer has a message to send, it simply sends the message to a specified topic. The producer doesn't need to register with the topic or partition. It's the responsibility of the Kafka broker to assign the message to a specific partition within the topic. This assignment can be done based on round-robin, a key provided in the message, or custom logic provided by the producer.

**Consumers**: Consumers subscribe to one or more topics that they are interested in. The Kafka broker keeps track of what messages have been delivered to a consumer by keeping track of the offset of messages. When a consumer has processed a message and is ready for the next one, it sends an acknowledgment to the broker, which then moves the offset forward.

So, in summary, producers and consumers interact with topics and partitions, but they don't register with them in the way you might register a callback with an event in other programming models. Instead, the Kafka broker keeps track of what messages each consumer has seen by managing offsets.

it's mean the producer will produce one kind of data in each brokver?
In Apache Kafka, a producer can send data to any topic, and that topic can be stored across multiple brokers depending on the number of partitions the topic has. Each message produced by the producer is written to a particular partition within a topic. The assignment of a message to a specific partition can be controlled by the producer itself or can be handled by Kafka.

If a topic has multiple partitions, the data produced to that topic will be distributed across the brokers that hold those partitions. This allows Kafka to store and process large volumes of data in a distributed and fault-tolerant manner.

So, a producer doesn't necessarily produce one kind of data in each broker. Instead, it produces data to a specific topic, and that data is then distributed across the Kafka cluster based on the topic's partition configuration.

How the topic will be distributed across the brokers? it is partition replicas?
Yes, you're correct. In Apache Kafka, a topic is divided into one or more partitions, and these partitions are distributed across the brokers in a Kafka cluster. Each partition can have multiple replicas for fault tolerance, and these replicas are also distributed across different brokers.

Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:

1. **Partitioning**: When a topic is created, it's divided into one or more partitions. The number of partitions for a topic can be specified at the time of topic creation.

2. **Replication**: Each partition can be replicated across a number of brokers based on the replication factor set for the topic. If the replication factor is set to 3, for example, then each partition will have 3 replicas.

3. **Leader and Follower**: Among the replicas of a partition, one is designated as the leader, and the others are followers. All writes and reads to a partition go through the leader, and the followers replicate the leader to provide fault tolerance.

4. **Distribution**: The leader and follower replicas for a partition are distributed across different brokers in the cluster. This distribution is handled by Kafka and ensures that no single broker is a single point of failure.

5. **Failover**: If a broker fails, Kafka will automatically failover by promoting a follower replica to be the new leader.

This architecture allows Kafka to be highly scalable and fault-tolerant. By partitioning topics and replicating partitions across brokers, Kafka can handle high volumes of reads and writes, and continue to operate in the face of broker failures.

In Apache Kafka, data is distributed among many clusters through the concept of topics, partitions, and replicas. Here's a simplified explanation:

1. **Topics**: When you send a message to Kafka, you send it to a specific topic. A topic is a category or feed name to which records are published.

2. **Partitions**: Topics in Kafka are split into partitions. Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of records that is continually appended to. When a producer publishes a message to a topic, Kafka assigns the message to a partition. The assignment of a message to a specific partition can be done based on round-robin, a key provided in the message, or custom logic provided by the producer.

3. **Replicas**: Each partition can be replicated across a configurable number of brokers for fault tolerance. This means that even if a broker fails, the data is still available on other brokers.

4. **Brokers and Clusters**: A Kafka cluster is composed of multiple brokers, and each broker can hold a number of topic partitions. The brokers work together to serve clients. If one broker fails, the data is still available on other brokers due to replication.

5. **Leaders and Followers**: Among the replicas of a partition, one is designated as the leader, and the others are followers. All writes and reads to a partition go through the leader, and the followers replicate the leader to provide fault tolerance.

So, in summary, when you send a message to Kafka, it gets assigned to a specific partition of a topic. This partition can be replicated across multiple brokers in a Kafka cluster, ensuring that the data is distributed and available even in the face of broker failures.

Ok, how we distributed data among many clusters?
In Apache Kafka, data is distributed among many clusters through the concept of topics, partitions, and replicas. Here's a simplified explanation:

1. **Topics**: When you send a message to Kafka, you send it to a specific topic. A topic is a category or feed name to which records are published.

2. **Partitions**: Topics in Kafka are split into partitions. Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of records that is continually appended to. When a producer publishes a message to a topic, Kafka assigns the message to a partition. The assignment of a message to a specific partition can be done based on round-robin, a key provided in the message, or custom logic provided by the producer.

3. **Replicas**: Each partition can be replicated across a configurable number of brokers for fault tolerance. This means that even if a broker fails, the data is still available on other brokers.

4. **Brokers and Clusters**: A Kafka cluster is composed of multiple brokers, and each broker can hold a number of topic partitions. The brokers work together to serve clients. If one broker fails, the data is still available on other brokers due to replication.

5. **Leaders and Followers**: Among the replicas of a partition, one is designated as the leader, and the others are followers. All writes and reads to a partition go through the leader, and the followers replicate the leader to provide fault tolerance.

So, in summary, when you send a message to Kafka, it gets assigned to a specific partition of a topic. This partition can be replicated across multiple brokers in a Kafka cluster, ensuring that the data is distributed and available even in the face of broker failures.

So Do we have away to replica partitions between clusters?
Yes, replicating partitions between clusters is possible in Apache Kafka, but it's not a built-in feature of Kafka itself. Instead, it's achieved using a tool called MirrorMaker, which is included with Apache Kafka.

MirrorMaker is a utility for mirroring data between two Kafka clusters. It's essentially a Kafka consumer and producer linked together: it consumes data from one Kafka cluster and produces it to another.

Here's a basic example of how you might use MirrorMaker to replicate data between two clusters:

```bash
./bin/kafka-mirror-maker.sh --consumer.config sourceClusterConsumerConfig.properties --producer.config targetClusterProducerConfig.properties --whitelist=".*"
```

In this command:

- `sourceClusterConsumerConfig.properties` is a configuration file that tells the MirrorMaker consumer how to connect to the source Kafka cluster.
- `targetClusterProducerConfig.properties` is a configuration file that tells the MirrorMaker producer how to connect to the target Kafka cluster.
- `--whitelist=".*"` tells MirrorMaker to replicate all topics.

Please note that while MirrorMaker can be used to replicate data between clusters, it does not handle failover between clusters. If you need to handle failover, you might need to use a more advanced tool or service. For example, Confluent, the company founded by the creators of Kafka, offers a multi-datacenter replication service as part of their Confluent Platform product.

So, while Kafka itself doesn't natively support replicating partitions between clusters, you can achieve this using MirrorMaker or other tools designed for this purpose.

because we need to load balance between cluster to increase availability
Yes, load balancing between clusters is crucial for increasing availability and fault tolerance in a distributed system like Apache Kafka. Load balancing ensures that the workload is distributed evenly across all nodes in the clusters, preventing any single node from becoming a bottleneck.

In the context of Kafka, load balancing can occur at several levels:

1. **Producer Level**: Producers can distribute messages evenly across all partitions of a topic, effectively load balancing the data being sent to the Kafka cluster.

2. **Broker Level**: Within a Kafka cluster, topics are divided into partitions and these partitions (and their replicas) are distributed across the available brokers. This distribution is handled by Kafka itself and ensures that no single broker is overloaded with too many partitions.

3. **Consumer Level**: Kafka consumers use a concept called Consumer Groups to achieve load balancing. Within a Consumer Group, each consumer is assigned a subset of the partitions from the topics they subscribe to, ensuring that the data is consumed in parallel.

4. **Cluster Level**: For load balancing across multiple Kafka clusters, tools like MirrorMaker or Confluent's Replicator can be used. These tools replicate data from one Kafka cluster to another, providing higher availability and disaster recovery.

Remember, the goal of load balancing is to optimize resource use, maximize throughput, minimize response time, and avoid overload of any single resource. By distributing the workload more evenly, load balancing helps in achieving these goals.

we can also say that each topic has its replica in every brokers?
No, it's not accurate to say that each topic has its replica in every broker. In Apache Kafka, a topic is divided into one or more partitions, and these partitions are distributed across the brokers in a Kafka cluster. Each partition can have multiple replicas for fault tolerance, and these replicas are also distributed across different brokers.

However, not every broker needs to have a replica of every partition. The distribution of partitions and their replicas across brokers is managed by Kafka and is designed to balance load across the brokers while also providing fault tolerance. If a broker fails, Kafka will automatically failover by promoting a follower replica to be the new leader.

So, while it's possible that a replica of a partition of a topic could exist on every broker, it's not a requirement or a guarantee. The actual distribution of partitions and replicas depends on the number of topics, the number of partitions per topic, the replication factor, and the number of brokers.

OK, so let back to partition, if each topic have multiple partions and produced data will be store into them, for example by round-robin.
How we can manage data will be sent and consummed, example we have 10 orders and the 5 first orders need to be processed first?
In Kafka, the order of messages is guaranteed only within a partition. That is, if messages are sent to different partitions, Kafka does not guarantee any specific order across those partitions. However, within a single partition, messages are ordered in the sequence they are produced.

If you have a requirement where certain messages (like the first 5 orders) need to be processed before others, you have a few options:

1. **Use a Single Partition**: If the order of processing is important, you could send all messages to a single partition. This ensures that the messages are processed in the order they were sent. However, this approach does not scale well as all messages are handled by a single consumer.

2. **Use a Key**: If the messages that need to be processed together share some common attribute, you could use that attribute as the key when producing messages. Kafka guarantees that all messages with the same key will end up in the same partition, and thus will be processed in order.

Here's an example of how you might produce messages with a key:

```java
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.*;

public class OrderProducer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.put("bootstrap.servers", "localhost:9092");
        props.put("key.serializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");
        props.put("value.serializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer");

        Producer<String, String> producer = new KafkaProducer<>(props);
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            String key = i < 5 ? "firstFive" : "lastFive";
            producer.send(new ProducerRecord<String, String>("orders", key, "Order " + i));
        }
        producer.close();
    }
}
```

In this example, the first 5 orders are sent with the key "firstFive", and the last 5 orders are sent with the key "lastFive". This ensures that all orders with the same key end up in the same partition and are processed in order.

Remember, the key is not just for ordering, it also affects the distribution of data across partitions. So, if you have a large number of keys, your data will be well distributed, but if you have only a few keys, some partitions may be much busier than others.


How topic will be create in real work, for example for order system?
In a real-world order system, you might create a Kafka topic for each type of event or transaction that you want to track. For example, you might have separate topics for "order_created", "order_updated", "order_shipped", etc.

Each of these topics would be used to publish messages related to the corresponding event. For example, when a new order is created in your system, you would publish a message to the "order_created" topic. This message might contain details about the order such as the order ID, customer ID, product ID, quantity, price, etc.

Here's an example of how you might create a topic in Kafka using the Kafka command line tools:

```bash
./bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic order_created
```

In this command:

- `--create` indicates that you want to create a new topic.
- `--bootstrap-server localhost:9092` specifies the address of your Kafka server.
- `--replication-factor 1` sets the replication factor for the topic, which is the number of copies of each message that Kafka should maintain for fault tolerance.
- `--partitions 1` sets the number of partitions for the topic, which affects how data is distributed across the Kafka cluster.
- `--topic order_created` is the name of the topic you want to create.

Please note that this is a basic example and the actual commands and configurations you use might vary depending on your specific requirements and the configuration of your Kafka cluster.

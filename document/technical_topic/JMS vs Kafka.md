### why we should use JMS intead of Kafka in banking system?
JMS (Java Message Service) and Kafka are both messaging systems, but they have different characteristics and use cases. Here are some reasons why you might choose to use JMS instead of Kafka in a banking system:

1. **Transactional Support**: JMS supports distributed transactions, which are crucial in banking systems where atomicity and consistency of transactions are required. Kafka, on the other hand, does not support distributed transactions.

2. **Message Consumption**: In JMS, once a message is consumed by a consumer, it is not available to other consumers. This is often desirable in banking systems where you don't want a message (like a transaction request) to be processed more than once. In Kafka, messages are not removed after consumption and can be read again, which might not be suitable for certain banking operations.

3. **Integration with Java EE**: JMS is a part of the Java EE specification and integrates well with other Java EE technologies like EJBs, application servers, and transaction management. If your banking system is built on Java EE, using JMS might be more convenient.

4. **Synchronous Communication**: JMS supports both synchronous and asynchronous message delivery. Synchronous delivery can be useful in banking systems where you need to wait for a response before proceeding.

5. **Complex Routing and Transformation**: If you need complex routing, message transformation, or orchestration, you might use JMS with a full-featured enterprise service bus (ESB) or integration platform.

Remember, the choice between JMS and Kafka (or any other technology) should be based on the specific requirements of your system. Kafka has its own strengths, like high throughput, fault-tolerance, and real-time processing, which make it a better choice for certain use cases.

### "JMS supports distributed transactions" how it do that?
JMS (Java Message Service) supports distributed transactions through the use of JTA (Java Transaction API). JTA is a high-level, protocol-agnostic API in Java that allows applications to perform distributed transactions, i.e., transactions that access and update data on multiple networked computer resources.

Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:

1. The application starts a new transaction using the `UserTransaction.begin()` method. This creates a new transaction context.

2. The application performs several operations that involve JMS messages. For example, it might send a message, update a database, and then send another message. All these operations are part of the same transaction.

3. If all operations succeed, the application commits the transaction using the `UserTransaction.commit()` method. This causes all the operations to take effect. If any of the operations fail, the application can roll back the transaction using the `UserTransaction.rollback()` method. This undoes all the operations that were part of the transaction.

4. The JMS provider and the database management system coordinate to ensure that the operations either all succeed or all fail, maintaining the integrity of the data.

Here's a simple example of how you might use JTA with JMS:

```java
import javax.jms.*;
import javax.transaction.UserTransaction;

// ...

UserTransaction ut = ... // obtain UserTransaction
Connection connection = ... // obtain JMS Connection
Session session = connection.createSession(false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);
MessageProducer producer = session.createProducer(queue);

try {
    ut.begin();

    // Perform several JMS operations
    TextMessage message = session.createTextMessage("Hello, World!");
    producer.send(message);

    // ...

    ut.commit();  // Commit the transaction
} catch (Exception e) {
    ut.rollback();  // Roll back the transaction
}
```

In this example, the `UserTransaction` object represents the distributed transaction. The `begin()` method starts the transaction, and the `commit()` method commits the transaction. If anything goes wrong, the `rollback()` method is called to roll back the transaction.

Please note that the actual code to obtain a `UserTransaction` and `Connection` object depends on your specific environment and configuration.

### We can do this with kafka as well?
Yes, Kafka can also be used in banking systems, but it's important to understand its characteristics and how they align with your system's requirements. Here are some reasons why you might choose Kafka:

1. **High Throughput**: Kafka is designed to handle real-time, high-volume data streams. It can process millions of messages per second, which can be beneficial for banking systems that need to process large amounts of transaction data in real time.

2. **Scalability**: Kafka is highly scalable. You can easily increase its capacity by adding more brokers to the Kafka cluster. This can be useful in banking systems that need to scale to handle increasing data volumes.

3. **Fault Tolerance**: Kafka provides strong durability and fault-tolerance guarantees through replication. If a broker fails, the data is still available on other brokers. This is crucial for banking systems where data loss is unacceptable.

4. **Real-Time Processing**: Kafka supports real-time data processing, which can be useful for banking systems that require real-time analytics or fraud detection.

5. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Kafka is built around an event-driven architecture, which can be a good fit for banking systems that are designed around events (like transactions).

However, it's important to note that Kafka does not support distributed transactions and once a message is consumed, it's still available to other consumers. These characteristics might not be suitable for certain banking operations.

Also, Kafka requires a separate system like ZooKeeper to manage its distributed system aspects, which can add complexity to your system.

As always, the choice between Kafka, JMS, or any other technology should be based on the specific requirements of your system.

### Teach me about kubernetes and how it is used with docker
Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.

Docker, on the other hand, is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications by encapsulating them into containers. A Docker container is a standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files.

Here's how Kubernetes and Docker work together:

1. **Containerization with Docker**: Docker helps in creating and managing containers for your applications. These containers are lightweight and can be easily moved between different environments, making them ideal for consistent development, testing, and deployment.

2. **Orchestration with Kubernetes**: While Docker is great at running containers, when you start to use containers at scale, you need a way to manage them. That's where Kubernetes comes in. Kubernetes provides a framework to run distributed systems resiliently by managing and orchestrating containers.

Key Concepts of Kubernetes:

- **Pods**: The smallest and simplest unit in the Kubernetes object model that you create or deploy. A Pod represents a running process on your cluster and can contain one or more containers.

- **Services**: An abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service. Services provide network connectivity to Pods across multiple nodes in a Kubernetes cluster.

- **Volumes**: A directory containing data, accessible to the containers in a pod. Kubernetes supports many types of volumes, including persistent volumes which outlive the lifetime of a pod.

- **Namespaces**: Virtual clusters backed by the same physical cluster. Namespaces are a way to divide cluster resources between multiple users.

- **Deployments**: A Deployment controller provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets. You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate.

Here's a simple example of how you might use Kubernetes with Docker:

1. First, you would create a Dockerfile that defines your application and its dependencies. You would then build a Docker image from this Dockerfile.

2. Next, you would create a Kubernetes Deployment configuration. This configuration specifies what Docker image to use for your application, how many replicas of your application to run, what ports to expose, and more.

3. You would then apply this Deployment configuration to your Kubernetes cluster using the `kubectl apply` command. Kubernetes would then pull the specified Docker image and start the specified number of replicas of your application.

4. Finally, you would create a Kubernetes Service to expose your application to the outside world. This Service would specify what ports to expose and how to route incoming traffic to your application Pods.

Here's an example of a simple Kubernetes Deployment configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app
        image: my-app:1.0.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

In this example, Kubernetes would pull the `my-app:1.0.0` Docker image and start 3 replicas of the application. Each replica would expose port 8080.

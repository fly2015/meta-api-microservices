### Java is asynchronous blocking?
Java supports both synchronous (blocking) and asynchronous (non-blocking) programming models.

In a synchronous programming model, when a thread invokes a method, it gets blocked until the method's return. The thread cannot do anything else during this time. This is also known as blocking I/O model because the thread is blocked until the I/O operation (like reading data from a network, database, or file system) is complete.

On the other hand, in an asynchronous programming model, a thread can initiate an I/O operation and then move on to do other things without waiting for the operation to complete. This is also known as non-blocking I/O model because the thread is not blocked and can perform other tasks.

Java provides support for asynchronous programming through various APIs and frameworks. For example, the `java.util.concurrent` package provides classes like `Future` and `CompletableFuture` that can be used for asynchronous programming. Similarly, the `java.nio` package provides non-blocking I/O capabilities. Furthermore, many modern Java frameworks like Spring WebFlux support building asynchronous and non-blocking applications.

Here is an example of asynchronous programming in Java using `CompletableFuture`:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

public class AsyncExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CompletableFuture<Void> future = CompletableFuture.runAsync(() -> {
            // Simulate a long-running task
            try {
                Thread.sleep(5000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                throw new IllegalStateException(e);
            }
            System.out.println("I'll run in a separate thread than the main thread.");
        });

        // Do other operations
        System.out.println("Doing other operations...");

        // Block and wait for the future to complete
        future.join();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `CompletableFuture.runAsync()` method is used to execute a task asynchronously in a separate thread. The main thread can continue doing other operations without waiting for the task to complete. The `future.join()` method is used to block and wait for the task to complete.

### you maybe wrong, java can achieve asynchronous by leverage threads by concurrency, but each thread still be in synchronous mode
You're correct that Java's concurrency model is primarily based on threads, which operate in a synchronous manner. However, Java also provides APIs and frameworks that allow for asynchronous programming, where a thread can initiate an operation and then move on to do other things without waiting for the operation to complete.

For example, the `java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture` class represents a Future that may be explicitly completed (setting its value and status), and may be used as a CompletionStage, supporting dependent functions and actions that trigger upon its completion.

Here's an example of how you might use `CompletableFuture` to achieve asynchronous behavior:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

public class AsyncExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CompletableFuture<Void> future = CompletableFuture.runAsync(() -> {
            // Simulate a long-running task
            try {
                Thread.sleep(5000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                throw new IllegalStateException(e);
            }
            System.out.println("I'll run in a separate thread than the main thread.");
        });

        // Do other operations
        System.out.println("Doing other operations...");

        // Block and wait for the future to complete
        future.join();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `CompletableFuture.runAsync()` method is used to execute a task asynchronously in a separate thread. The main thread can continue doing other operations without waiting for the task to complete. The `future.join()` method is used to block and wait for the task to complete.

So while it's true that each individual thread operates in a synchronous manner, Java provides mechanisms to achieve asynchronous behavior at a higher level.

### it can async because main thread delegate its work to another thread behind
Yes, you're correct. In Java, the main thread can delegate its work to another thread, allowing it to continue with other tasks. This is a form of asynchronous behavior. The main thread doesn't have to wait for the delegated task to complete, it can proceed with its own execution and check the result of the other task at a later point. This is often achieved using Java's concurrency utilities, such as `Future` and `CompletableFuture`.

Here's a simple example:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Delegate a task to another thread
        CompletableFuture<Void> future = CompletableFuture.runAsync(() -> {
            try {
                // Simulate a long-running task
                Thread.sleep(5000);
                System.out.println("Task completed");
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                throw new IllegalStateException(e);
            }
        });

        // Main thread continues with other tasks
        System.out.println("Main thread continues with other tasks");

        // At some later point, main thread can check if the task is done
        if(future.isDone()) {
            System.out.println("Delegated task is done");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Delegated task is not done yet");
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the main thread delegates a long-running task to another thread using `CompletableFuture.runAsync()`. It then continues with its own tasks. Later, it checks if the delegated task is done using `future.isDone()`.

### but each thread is till blocking I-O, so it's only asynchronous, it's not non-blocking io
You're correct. In Java, even when using threads to achieve a form of asynchronous behavior, the I/O operations themselves are still blocking. When a thread is waiting for an I/O operation to complete, it is blocked and cannot do anything else.

However, Java does provide a way to perform non-blocking I/O operations through the `java.nio` package. The `java.nio.channels` package provides the `SelectableChannel` class, which is the base class for selectable channels. A selectable channel can be registered with a `Selector`, allowing the thread to monitor multiple channels for I/O readiness, such as readiness for reading or writing. This way, a single thread can manage multiple channels (and therefore multiple network connections), which can be much more efficient than using a thread per connection.

Here's a simple example of how you might use `java.nio` to perform non-blocking I/O:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.InetSocketAddress;
import java.nio.ByteBuffer;
import java.nio.channels.SocketChannel;

public class NonBlockingIOExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Open a socket channel
            SocketChannel socketChannel = SocketChannel.open();
            socketChannel.configureBlocking(false);
            socketChannel.connect(new InetSocketAddress("localhost", 8080));

            while (!socketChannel.finishConnect()) {
                // Non-blocking, do something else
            }

            // Write a message
            String message = "Hello, World!";
            ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.wrap(message.getBytes());
            while (buffer.hasRemaining()) {
                socketChannel.write(buffer);
            }

            // Read a message
            buffer.clear();
            while (socketChannel.read(buffer) > 0) {
                buffer.flip();
                while (buffer.hasRemaining()) {
                    System.out.print((char) buffer.get());
                }
                buffer.clear();
            }

            socketChannel.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, a `SocketChannel` is opened and configured to be non-blocking. It then connects to a server and sends a message. The reading and writing operations are performed in a non-blocking manner.

### I mean more detail about SocketChannel above
`SocketChannel` is a part of the `java.nio.channels` package in Java. It's a selectable channel for stream-oriented connecting sockets.

The `SocketChannel` class provides the following methods:

- `open()`: Opens a socket channel.
- `connect(SocketAddress remote)`: Connects this channel's socket.
- `finishConnect()`: Finishes the process of connecting a socket channel.
- `read(ByteBuffer dst)`: Reads a sequence of bytes from this channel into the given buffer.
- `write(ByteBuffer src)`: Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer.
- `socket()`: Retrieves a socket associated with this channel.
- `isConnected()`: Tells whether or not this channel's network socket is connected.
- `isConnectionPending()`: Tells whether or not a connection operation is in progress on this channel.

Here's a more detailed example of how you might use `SocketChannel` to perform non-blocking I/O:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.InetSocketAddress;
import java.nio.ByteBuffer;
import java.nio.channels.SocketChannel;

public class NonBlockingIOExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Open a socket channel
            SocketChannel socketChannel = SocketChannel.open();
            socketChannel.configureBlocking(false);
            socketChannel.connect(new InetSocketAddress("localhost", 8080));

            // Wait until the connection is finished
            while (!socketChannel.finishConnect()) {
                // Non-blocking, do something else
                System.out.println("Connection is pending, do something else...");
            }

            // Write a message
            String message = "Hello, World!";
            ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.wrap(message.getBytes());
            while (buffer.hasRemaining()) {
                socketChannel.write(buffer);
            }

            // Read a message
            buffer.clear();
            int bytesRead;
            while ((bytesRead = socketChannel.read(buffer)) != -1) {
                buffer.flip();
                while (buffer.hasRemaining()) {
                    System.out.print((char) buffer.get());
                }
                buffer.clear();
            }

            socketChannel.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, a `SocketChannel` is opened and configured to be non-blocking. It then connects to a server and sends a message. The reading and writing operations are performed in a non-blocking manner. The `read()` method returns `-1` when it reaches the end of the stream.

### OK, so please distinguish between asynchronous blocking I-O vs asynchronous Non-blocking. This caused confusion to many developers
Sure, let's clarify these terms:

**Asynchronous Blocking I/O**: In this model, a thread can initiate an I/O operation and then move on to do other things without waiting for the operation to complete. This is the "asynchronous" part. However, when the thread checks the result of the I/O operation, if the operation is not yet complete, the thread will block until the operation is complete. This is the "blocking" part.

In Java, this can be achieved using classes like `Future` and `CompletableFuture`. The thread can initiate an operation, get a `Future`, and then do other things. When it needs the result of the operation, it calls `Future.get()`, which blocks if the operation is not yet complete.

**Asynchronous Non-blocking I/O**: In this model, a thread can initiate an I/O operation and then move on to do other things without waiting for the operation to complete. When the thread checks the result of the I/O operation, if the operation is not yet complete, the thread can immediately get a status indicating that the operation is not yet complete, and it can continue doing other things. The thread is never blocked waiting for an I/O operation to complete.

In Java, this can be achieved using the `java.nio.channels` package, which provides non-blocking I/O capabilities. The thread can initiate an I/O operation, get a `SelectableChannel`, and then use a `Selector` to find out which channels have I/O operations that are ready to proceed.

In summary, the difference between asynchronous blocking I/O and asynchronous non-blocking I/O is about what happens when the thread checks the result of an I/O operation. In the blocking model, the thread will block if the operation is not yet complete. In the non-blocking model, the thread will never block, but instead gets an immediate status indicating whether the operation is complete or not.

### I have heard that in Os level, we can achieve non-blocking with only one thread?
Yes, that's correct. At the operating system level, it's possible to achieve non-blocking I/O with a single thread. This is often done using system calls provided by the operating system that allow a thread to initiate an I/O operation and then continue doing other things without waiting for the operation to complete.

In Java, this can be achieved using the `java.nio.channels` package, which provides non-blocking I/O capabilities. The thread can initiate an I/O operation, get a `SelectableChannel`, and then use a `Selector` to find out which channels have I/O operations that are ready to proceed.

Here's a simple example of how you might use `java.nio` to perform non-blocking I/O with a single thread:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.InetSocketAddress;
import java.nio.ByteBuffer;
import java.nio.channels.SelectionKey;
import java.nio.channels.Selector;
import java.nio.channels.SocketChannel;
import java.util.Iterator;

public class NonBlockingIOExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Open a socket channel
            SocketChannel socketChannel = SocketChannel.open();
            socketChannel.configureBlocking(false);
            socketChannel.connect(new InetSocketAddress("localhost", 8080));

            // Open a selector
            Selector selector = Selector.open();

            // Register the channel with the selector to be notified when connection is complete
            socketChannel.register(selector, SelectionKey.OP_CONNECT);

            while (true) {
                // Wait for an event
                selector.select();

                // Get an iterator over the selected keys
                Iterator<SelectionKey> keys = selector.selectedKeys().iterator();

                while (keys.hasNext()) {
                    SelectionKey key = keys.next();
                    keys.remove();

                    if (key.isConnectable()) {
                        // Finish the connection process
                        socketChannel.finishConnect();

                        // Register the channel with the selector to be notified when data is ready to read
                        socketChannel.register(selector, SelectionKey.OP_READ);

                        // Write a message
                        String message = "Hello, World!";
                        ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.wrap(message.getBytes());
                        while (buffer.hasRemaining()) {
                            socketChannel.write(buffer);
                        }
                    } else if (key.isReadable()) {
                        // Read the data
                        ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);
                        int bytesRead = socketChannel.read(buffer);
                        while (bytesRead > 0) {
                            buffer.flip();
                            while (buffer.hasRemaining()) {
                                System.out.print((char) buffer.get());
                            }
                            buffer.clear();
                            bytesRead = socketChannel.read(buffer);
                        }

                        socketChannel.close();
                        return;
                    }
                }
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, a `SocketChannel` is opened and configured to be non-blocking. It then connects to a server and sends a message. The reading and writing operations are performed in a non-blocking manner. The `Selector` is used to wait for events (like connection completion and data readiness) on the `SocketChannel`. This allows a single thread to manage the I/O operations without blocking.

### Non-blocking and Non-blocking I/O is the same or not?
Non-blocking and Non-blocking I/O are essentially the same concept. Both refer to a method of handling input/output (I/O) operations where the execution does not block the entire system or process. This means that a process can continue to run and perform other tasks while the I/O operation is still in progress. This is typically achieved through multi-threading or asynchronous programming.

In the context of programming and system design, non-blocking is often used to describe the behavior of any operation, not just I/O, that allows other operations to proceed without waiting for the first operation to complete. Non-blocking I/O, on the other hand, specifically refers to I/O operations that do not block the process or system.
